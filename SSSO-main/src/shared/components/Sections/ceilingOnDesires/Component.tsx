              Man makes every attempt to be happy. But without understanding the
              true meaning of happiness, he becomes perplexed and agitated. He
              equates happiness with the gratification of his desires and thus
              constantly engages in the pursuit of acquiring or amassing objects
              of comfort and pleasure. Believing that these can bring lasting
              happiness, he never finds contentment. Once one desire is
              fulfilled, he begins to crave another.

              It is natural in daily life to have a desire for certain

              three are most essential:
              <Typography variant="h4" color="primary.main">

              distant to him. If desires are gratified, one’s ahamkara (ego)
              gets inflated. If they are not realized, hatred gets generated.

              desires in life and lead a prodigal life. That is why Bhagawan
              Baba gave the mantra, “Want not, waste not”, which is the

              Whenever a desire arises in the mind, one should exercise the

              based on the dictum of “Waste not, Want not,” the concept revolves
              around two fundamental pillars. They include:

              When you acquire heavy weight, you go down. If our lives get
              filled with unnecessary wants and desires, we cannot rise higher

              comfort makes travel a pleasure!" But it is not enough if we
              reduce our wants to minimum. Simultaneously, we need to give up

              devotes a small fraction of his attention to the down-trodden
              section of the society, he can easily notice that how people are
              surviving by having their basic necessities of food, shelter and

            <Typography variant="h4Medium" color="primary.main">
              Money is one of the primary bases of all human beings. Without
              money, one cannot even think of a walk — a single step in life.
              However, instead of treating money as a necessity, man tends to
              seek more and more in order to pursue power. They consider that
              “money” can usher joy, peace, and happiness in life.
              Unfortunately, they don’t know that there is no direct link
              between income and happiness.

            <Typography variant="h4Medium" color="primary.main">
              Although money is essential, we should also acknowledge that if it
              is not utilized in moderation, it impacts our sense of morality
              and virtue, our spiritual relationships, our mental as well as
              physical health.

                “Don't waste money. God is wealth. Since God is wealth, misuse
                of money is evil. Practice charity by gifting away money, food,
                clothes, houses, etc., instead of misusing money in
                extravagance. Misuse of money is not only evil but a sin as

              A few pointers that may help us in ensuring that money is used
              diligently are:

                  Plan your essential expenses and set a budget strive not to

                <li>
                  Do not spend on things that are not needed; put an end to
                  making impulsive purchases.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Do not spend all that you earn; put some money into savings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Do not take loans for unproductive expenses; avoid credit
                  cards.
